0x18. C - Dynamic libraries
In this project, I learnt:
* What is a dynamic library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it
* What is the environment variable $LD_LIBRARY_PATH and how to use it
* What are the differences between static and shared libraries
* Basic usage nm, ldd, ldconfig
